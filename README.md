# What is necessary

Extra-booster -> 45% -> 0, 1.2, 1.8 OKAY
Different strain -> Original, Delta, Omicron, Omicron BA2 (Transmission 1.2x Omicron, immunity escape 50%) OKAY
Days of test -> Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; Monday and Thursday OKAY: baseline Mo, Thur

Calibrate for R0 with no testing -> 1.0 -> LATENT

## Scenario 0

Baseline scenario:

- Testing general population 5+ yo if severe with PCR.

## Scenario 1

- Testing general population 5+ yo if severe with PCR.

- Testing with PRC 50% of the population if mild case.


## Scenario 2

- Testing general population 5+ yo if severe with PCR.

- Testing with RA the population if mild case.


## Scenario 3

- Testing general population 5+ yo if severe with PCR.

- Testing with RA the working population if mild case.

- Asymptomatic testing of working population with RA.


## Scenario 4

- Testing general population 5+ yo if severe with PCR.

- Testing with RA the working population if mild case.

- Asymptomatic testing of working population with RA and follow up with PCR if positive.




# TO DO

- change the daysinf feature &rarr; okay

- Change the sensitivity (chad) &rarr; OKAY

- Asymptomatic -> reduction of 40% &rarr; OKAY
